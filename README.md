## a.) Discussion of parallel algorithms implemented in your program

The following algorithms were parallelized using CUDA:
1. Computation of Gradients
2. Orientation of binning 
3. Normalization of the Gradients

//todo explain the parallelization

## b.) Execution time comparison between sequential and parallel

//todo insert table for comparison

## c.) Detailed analysis and discussion of results
